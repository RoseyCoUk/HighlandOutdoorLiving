#### **Shed Base Requirements**
```
📚 EDUCATIONAL: SHED BASE REQUIREMENTS

Did you know most shed companies require TWO concrete bases? Here's why NMG is different:

❌ Competitors: 2 bases = £800-1200 extra cost
✅ NMG: 1 base = Save hundreds of pounds

Our galvanized steel frames are strong enough for single base installation!
