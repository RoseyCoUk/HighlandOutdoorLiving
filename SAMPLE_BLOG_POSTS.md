# Steel Shed Installation: Single Base vs Double Base - Which Saves You Money in Northern Ireland?

When planning your steel shed installation in Northern Ireland, one of the biggest cost factors is the concrete base requirement. Most steel shed companies, including Steel Tech NI and Adman Steel Sheds, require **TWO concrete bases** for their installations. However, NMG Outdoor Living's galvanized steel sheds require only **ONE concrete base**, saving you hundreds of pounds.

## The Double Base Problem

### Why Do Competitors Require Two Bases?

Traditional steel shed companies like Steel Tech NI and Adman Steel Sheds require two concrete bases because:

- **Weaker steel frame construction** - needs additional support
- **Outdated design** - not optimized for single base installation
- **Higher material costs** - more concrete, more labor, more time

### The Hidden Costs of Double Base Installation

When you choose a competitor requiring double bases, you're paying for:

- **Base 1**: ¬£400-600 (main foundation)
- **Base 2**: ¬£300-500 (additional support)
- **Extra labor**: ¬£200-400 (additional installation time)
- **Total extra cost**: ¬£900-1500

## The NMG Single Base Advantage

### Why Our Steel Sheds Need Only One Base

NMG's galvanized steel sheds are engineered for single base installation:

- **Heavy-duty galvanized steel frame** - superior strength
- **Advanced engineering** - optimized for single base support
- **Weather-resistant design** - built for Northern Ireland's climate
- **Professional installation** - expert team ensures proper setup

### Cost Savings with NMG

Choosing NMG over competitors saves you:

- **Single base cost**: ¬£400-600
- **No second base needed**: Save ¬£300-500
- **Faster installation**: Save ¬£200-400 in labor
- **Total savings**: ¬£800-1200

## Real Customer Example

**Sarah from Belfast** was quoted ¬£2,800 for a steel shed from a competitor requiring double bases. She chose NMG instead:

- **Competitor quote**: ¬£2,800 (including double base)
- **NMG quote**: ¬£1,900 (single base installation)
- **Savings**: ¬£900
- **Installation time**: 2 days vs 4 days

*"I couldn't believe the difference in cost. NMG's single base installation saved me ¬£900 and was completed in half the time. The quality is excellent and the shed is perfect for Belfast's weather."* - Sarah M., Belfast

# Outdoor Sauna Heat-Up Times: 15 Minutes vs 60 Minutes - The Energy Cost Difference

When choosing an outdoor sauna for your Northern Ireland garden, heat-up time is a crucial factor affecting both convenience and energy costs. Traditional wooden saunas from companies like Aquasun NI and Awaken Saunas typically take **45-60 minutes** to reach full temperature. However, NMG's steel-framed saunas heat up in just **15-20 minutes**, saving you time and money.

## The Traditional Sauna Problem

### Why Do Wooden Saunas Take So Long to Heat Up?

Traditional wooden saunas from competitors like Aquasun NI and Awaken Saunas have slow heat-up times because:

- **Poor insulation** - heat escapes through wooden construction
- **Inefficient heating** - traditional heaters not optimized for quick heating
- **Weather vulnerability** - wooden construction loses heat in cold weather
- **Outdated design** - not built for modern energy efficiency

### The Hidden Energy Costs

A traditional sauna taking 60 minutes to heat up costs:

- **Heating time**: 60 minutes per session
- **Energy consumption**: 6-8 kWh per session
- **Daily cost** (2 sessions): ¬£3-4 per day
- **Monthly cost**: ¬£90-120 per month
- **Annual cost**: ¬£1,080-1,440 per year

## The NMG Steel-Framed Advantage

### Why Our Saunas Heat Up in 15-20 Minutes

NMG's steel-framed saunas achieve fast heat-up times through:

- **Superior insulation** - steel frame with high-quality insulation
- **Efficient heating system** - optimized for quick heating
- **Weather-resistant design** - maintains heat in cold weather
- **Modern engineering** - built for energy efficiency

### Energy Savings with NMG

Choosing NMG over traditional saunas saves you:

- **Heating time**: 15-20 minutes vs 45-60 minutes
- **Energy consumption**: 2-3 kWh vs 6-8 kWh per session
- **Daily cost** (2 sessions): ¬£1-1.50 vs ¬£3-4
- **Monthly savings**: ¬£60-90
- **Annual savings**: ¬£720-1,080

## Real Customer Example

**Michael from Derry** switched from a traditional wooden sauna to NMG's steel-framed sauna:

- **Previous sauna**: 50-minute heat-up, ¬£4 per day
- **NMG sauna**: 18-minute heat-up, ¬£1.50 per day
- **Daily savings**: ¬£2.50
- **Annual savings**: ¬£912
- **Time savings**: 32 minutes per session

*"The difference is incredible. My NMG sauna heats up in 18 minutes compared to 50 minutes with my old wooden sauna. I'm saving over ¬£900 per year on energy costs and have more time to enjoy my sauna."* - Michael D., Derry
